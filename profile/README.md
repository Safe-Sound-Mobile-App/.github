# Safe & Sound: AI-Powered Elderly Care Application 👵❤️

## 📖 About Safe & Sound
Safe & Sound is an intelligent mobile application designed to enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals. By integrating AI-driven analysis with data from wearable devices, the system provides real-time monitoring of key physiological indicators, including heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and gyroscopic movement. Safe & Sound detects abnormal patterns and fluctuations, providing timely alerts to caregivers and enabling proactive intervention.

## 🚀 Features
-   **Smart & Precaution Notification:** Sends alerts to caregivers' mobile devices when abnormal patterns are detected, categorized into three levels (Normal, Warning, Danger).
-   **Emergency & Panic Alert:** Enables the elderly user’s device to emit a loud sound to help locate them in case of an emergency.
-   **Manual-pressing Rescue:** Allows elderly users to manually trigger an emergency alert by pressing a button on the app.
-   **Location-based Alerts:** Provides real-time location tracking and alerts to caregivers if an elderly individual experiences a potential emergency.
-   **AI-Driven Monitoring:** Continuously tracks heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and gyroscopic data to detect abnormalities.
-   **User-friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind for both elderly users and caregivers.

## 📖 How It Works
1.  The Safe & Sound mobile application connects to wearable devices to collect real-time physiological data from elderly users.
2.  The application sends this data to the backend server.
3.  The backend server processes the data and forwards it to the AI server for analysis.
4.  The AI server analyzes the data to detect abnormal patterns or events, such as falls or sudden changes in vital signs.
5.  If an emergency is detected, the AI server sends an alert to the backend server.
6.  The backend server sends notifications to the caregiver's mobile application.
7.  Caregivers receive immediate alerts and can view the elderly user's status and location.
8.  Elderly users can also trigger manual alerts through the mobile application.
